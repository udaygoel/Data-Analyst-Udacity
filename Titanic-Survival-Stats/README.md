# Titanic-Survival-Stats
The objective of this project is to explore the data set for the passengers on RMS Titanic and  provide answer to particular questions. 

### Project Files

The project uses these files:

- titanic_data.csv: This csv has the passenger data in a tabular form and forms the full dataset available for this project
- Data Fields description - Kaggle: This pdf is a snapshot of the description of the fields in the dataset. This information can also be found on [Kaggle under Data Dictionary](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- Titanic Data.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains all the analysis, code and the visualizations
- Titanic Data.html: This is the html output of the Jupyter Notebook.

### Objective

This project analyses which factors made a significant impact to the chances of survival. The factors considered are:

- Class of Cabin - this variable is a proxy for socio-economic status. 
- Gender
- Age - Categorised as adult or child.

The project also considers combination of these factors in the analysis. 

The analysis does not provide an answer to the cause of the survival rate but instead, tells us which factor(s), or combination of factors, experienced a higher or lower rate of survival in this accident.

### Contents

There are 3 main sections of the Project.

1. Data Wrangling

   This section investigates the data to spot any inconsistencies or issues that need to be cleaned up.  I have identified 3 inconsistencies and analysed these to understand the limitations these will introduce in the final analysis. I have also been able to clean some data and fill missing values by learning from the values in other variables.

2. Data Exploration

   This section explores the data to answer the questions in the Objective. I have applied univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis through the use of multiple plots to visually understand the results.

3. Conclusions

   This section summarises the assumptions and enhancements done to data. Then, it proceeds to give 4 conclusions from the analysis.
